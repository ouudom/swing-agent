"""AUDUSD instrument config — aussie vs USD. Inherits FX-major defaults from config._fx_base.

USD-quote major, same class as EURUSD/GBPUSD (USD_BETA_SIGN=-1, pip=0.0001, TICK 100000).
Onboarded under D024 (7-pair expansion, pair #1). Differences vs EUR/GBP:
  - No daily FRED policy series for the RBA (monthly OECD only) → RATE_FOREIGN=None; the
    rate_diff macro block keeps the US2Y direction leg + VIX and skips the carry diff
    (carry-diff was DEAD for EUR/GBP anyway — D021).
  - AUD is a commodity/China-beta currency: RBA + China tier-1 data (CPI/PMI/trade) are
    event blocks; iron-ore/copper context has no free daily series — narrative only.
  - Antipodean correlation: AUDUSD+NZDUSD same direction ≈ one bet (corr ~0.85) — the
    fx_exposure ledger emits an advisory note (D024).
Signal character (mean-reversion vs momentum) = decided by the P3 scan, not assumed.
