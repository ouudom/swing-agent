"""NZDUSD instrument config — kiwi vs USD. Inherits FX-major defaults from config._fx_base.

USD-quote major, same class as AUDUSD/EURUSD/GBPUSD (USD_BETA_SIGN=-1, pip=0.0001, TICK 100000).
Onboarded under D024 (7-pair expansion, pair #2). Same data caveats as AUDUSD:
  - No daily FRED policy series for the RBNZ (monthly OECD only) → RATE_FOREIGN=None; the
    rate_diff macro block keeps the US2Y direction leg + VIX and skips the carry diff.
  - NZD is a commodity/China-beta currency (dairy instead of iron ore): RBNZ + China tier-1 +
    GDT dairy auctions are event considerations; no free daily commodity series — narrative only.
  - Antipodean correlation: AUDUSD+NZDUSD same direction ≈ one bet (corr ~0.85) — fx_exposure
    ledger emits an advisory note (D024).
Signal character = decided by the P3 scan, not assumed (AUD scanned mean-reverting H4-centric).
