# EURGBP — Zone & Entry Confluence Scoring (ACTIVE)

> **STATUS: ACTIVE — 2026-06-09.** Derived from prior measured edge scan
> (EG3 D1 16yr + H4/H1 2020→now). Same two-score shape as the USD-majors, but **macro demoted to a
> 0.5 tilt** (EG2: cross macro thin/dead) and **NO VIX veto** (inverted risk-off polarity). H1/H4
> oscillator rows **validated** on real intraday (H1 t up to 7.45, both directions). Sizing in USD,
> no GBP convert (operator). All EURGBP orders route through the netting ledger ([[currency_exposure]]).

## Headline research constraint — MEAN-REVERTING, MACRO-LIGHT, NO USD LEG

**EURGBP is MEAN-REVERTING** (EG3, same DNA as the majors). Fade extremes; never pro-trend.
Unlike the majors there are **no momentum exceptions** — macro carries no significant edge on a
cross (EG2). Anti-edges (never score):
- Donchian20 breakdown short (−13.7pp, t=−4.24) — it's a long-side fade zone
- Near-20d-LOW used as a SHORT (−9.2pp, t=−4.53) — long-side fade
- PSAR / EMA-regime / ROC / Supertrend continuation (all negative t)

Core edge: **buy 20d-low / oversold, sell 20d-high / overbought.** Structure = the fade point.
Long (oversold-fade) is the richer side on this range-bound cross.

## R1 — Zone Confluence (at `/weekly`, max 10.0, floor 5.0)

| # | Signal | Weight | Pass when | Evidence (EG3 D1, 16yr) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Z1 | **Structural Zone (D1 extreme)** | **3.0** | Zone at 20d/swing HIGH (short) or LOW (long), D1/W1 S/R. **MANDATORY.** | Near 20d LOW long +9.3pp t=4.61 |
| Z2 | **Oscillator Extreme (D1)** | **2.5** | D1 RSI<35/<30 or Stoch<20 or CCI<−100 or Keltner-low (long); RSI>65 / CCI>+100 (short) | RSI<30 long +16.7 t=3.32; Keltner-low +11.9 t=4.51; CCI<−100 +9.8 t=4.32 |
| Z3 | **H1 Oscillator Confirm** | **1.5** | H1 RSI<35/<30 or Stoch<20 (long); RSI>65 / Stoch>80 (short) | RSI<30 long +7.7 t=6.47; %R<−80 long t=7.42; RSI>65 short t=3.42 |
| Z4 | **Macro / Sentiment Tilt** | **0.5** | EUR−GBP rate diff 5d widening → long, AND/OR VIX 1d spike>3 → long. **Tilt only.** | X3 long +7.5pp t=1.50; E16 long +6.7pp t=1.68 (both sub-significant) |
| Z5 | **Non-Trend Gate (ADX<25)** | **1.0** | D1 ADX(14) < 25 | trend-follow anti-edge (Donchian breakdown −13.7 t=−4.24) |
| Z6 | **Band / Compression (H4/D1)** | **0.5** | Keltner touch, D1 ATR<20-med, BB squeeze | mild timing edge |
| Z7 | **Williams / Stoch secondary confirm** | **1.0** | Williams%R<−80 (long) / >−20 (short), or Stoch K<20/>80 on fade side | %R<−80 long +5.4 t=3.52; %R>−20 short +3.9 t=2.22 |
| | **Total** | **10.0** | | |

**0-point vetoes:** D1 ADX>30 trending against the fade → block **SHORT** zones only (LONG fades in
ADX>30 are the strongest bucket, 9.5k-event backtest avgR +0.064 vs +0.012 at ADX<20 — never veto).
**NO VIX veto** (risk-off favors
EURGBP UP — inverted vs majors). **NO DXY block** (USD index irrelevant to the cross).
**Active-squeeze skip:** if D1 or H4 TTM squeeze is ON at publish time, do not publish the zone side
that sits on the far side of the squeeze break (i.e. the direction price would resolve INTO if the
squeeze fires against the fade) — either skip that side or require the zone edge ≥1 squeeze-band-width
beyond the rails. First 3 completed EURGBP fills all lost, all gate-flagged (V1/V1b/V3): the squeeze
resolution and the SL breach were the same move. Generalizes the ad-hoc W28 0.8580 flag in `runtime state`.
**Floor:** 5.0/10. Z1 mandatory.
**Macro is NOT a gate** (EG2 dead) — scored only as the Z4 0.5 tilt. The ~1.5 pts freed vs the
majors' macro weighting were redistributed to structure (Z1 2.5→3.0) + oscillator (Z2 2.0→2.5).

## R2 — Entry Confluence (at `/validate`, max 10.0, floor 5.0)

| # | Signal | Weight | Pass when | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E0 | **Entry Confirmation** | **3.0** | At zone, 1H close: **PRIMARY pin/engulf** toward fade · 2nd band-reclaim / close-strength · 15M CHoCH AGAINST approach | pin wins backtest (avgR +0.143); RSI-reclaim weak here (+0.053). PENDING live validation (D027) |
| E1 | **D1 Oscillator Still Extreme** | **2.5** | D1 RSI/Stoch/CCI still beyond fade threshold | strongest live gate |
| E2 | **H1 Oscillator Extreme Today** | **1.5** | H1 RSI<30/>65 or Stoch<20/>80 on the fade side | H1 oscillators highly significant both sides (t up to 7.45) |
| E3 | **Still Non-Trending (ADX<25)** | **1.0** | D1 ADX<25 | |
| E4 | **Structure / Band Intact** | **1.0** | 20d extreme / band not broken on D1 close | |
| E5 | **Compression Holds** | **1.0** | D1 ATR<20-med | |
| | **Total** | **10.0** | | |

**R reminder:** EURGBP R is computed in USD like the majors, no GBP convert (operator decision;
see [[eurgbp_profile]]). **Netting:** route every order through `scripts/advisory/fx_exposure.py` — EURGBP
IS the cross axis (see [[currency_exposure]]).

**Invalidation:** D1 CLOSE beyond the zone in the fade-against direction = dead (became a
breakout/trend). V1b = 2 consecutive H4 closes >0.25×H4 ATR14 past zone (ATR-scaled default,
`scripts/gates/check_v1b.py`; pass `--buffer` for a static override).

**Output per zone:** ✅ ORDER LIMIT | ❌ NO TRADE / INVALIDATED.

## Status notes
- ✅ H4/H1 pulled + validated (2020→now): Z3/E2 H1 oscillator edges confirmed, both directions.
- ✅ EG5 wiring done (`/weekly`+`/validate` params, forecast dirs, netting gate).
- Short-side fades: D1 short signals are thinner — lean on **intraday** (H1/H4) oscillator extremes
  for the short E0/E2 trigger.
- COT (derived 6E vs 6B) remains context-only, not built — optional future enhancement.
